# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 16, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to use card turn over in CSS, using animations.

**Thoughts:** I'm still not all the way there using BEM and nesting in SaSS, but I feel like I'm closer each day. Looking forward to continue tommorow.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tours section of the landing page.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting tired of following tutorials, can't wait to build stuff on my own, with the new skills aquired.
